- 👋 Hi, I’m @Teesgit123
- 👀 I’m interested in improving my collaboration skills, web development, and learning how to think like a programmer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via the Odin Project, about how to get started with programming and asking for help before doing web development bootcamps for the next 6 months
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a growing list of topics, but right now it is about learning how to think like a programmer.
- 📫 How to reach me: Github for right now.
